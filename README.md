# hello! üôå

this is my personal stuff, that i want to share on github~

(i don't have any blogs alr (‚Å†‡πë‚Å†‚Ä¢‚Å†Ôπè‚Å†‚Ä¢‚Å†))

## don't take a look on "tech diary"

i discontinued that in favor of One UI 5.1

i posted about what things that i back up + my debloat list on my phone!

### but- you can still debloat on One UI 5.1 right?!

debloating with the previous list won't do much for the RAM

i made the One UI 6 version just to match the One UI 5's RAM usage on boot (which is ~3.2 GB)

## what the "college" folder doing?

it's source code archive from the "basic programming" course üëÄ

(aka. programs that i made during the 1st semester of college)

# do not read this statement below

not using :3 because i thought it's cringe on public but i rly want to (‚Å†‚ï•‚Å†Ôπè‚Å†‚ï•‚Å†)

# Hello! üôå
this is my personal experience before rooting my own device, Samsung Galaxy A34

# first things first, BACK UP all your data !!
* if you have Samsung account, just back it up through their cloud (recommended)
* you can optionally back up through your Google account, that all is on Settings > Accounts and backup
* back up internal storage to sd card / another computer / another phone / etc.

## why Samsung cloud?
it also backs up apps + games installed outside play store, i found it very convenient

## my backup suggestions
* for WhatsApp, do NOT forget to back up through WA settings, then copy/move everything from Android/data/com.whatsapp, that includes downloaded medias
* for LINE, i guess just back up through google drive thingy etc., my phone number is banned from registration because i repeatedly reset phone lmoai i forgot
* i back up my internal storage with FX File Explorer, selecting all folders on there, and then make it .zip, i store without compressing just to be safe if in case my data got corrupted there, and then moving it to my laptop
* i love stacked widgets, so i also made a backup of it (+ i back up my debloat list)

# if you're planning to root
to do so, you need to:
- know how to enable developer options (hin: just spam tap ~7 times on build number)
- enable OEM unlock which is located on developer options
- obviously know your lockscreen password, biometrics will not work
- choose what rooting solution that you will use

## Before proceeding
- rooting will void warranty
- i use magisk to root my device, if you prefer another rooting solution then this might be of no use here, sorry üôè

for magisk, you can also LOOK at this samsung-specific tutorial on official Magisk https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/install.html#samsung-devices

## resetting from rooted device?

also back up your magisk modules!

here is my example:

* ADB & Fastboot for Android NDK
* Busybox for Android NDK
* GMS Doze
* Hex-Installer-Module
* KnoxPatch Enhancer
* Magisk Bootloop Protector
* None Display Cutout
* Play Integrity NEXT
* Remove /proc/stat restriction
* Small Battery
* YouTube ReVanced Extended
* Zygisk - LSPosed

# Hello! ðŸ™Œ
this is my personal experience on rooting and setting up my own device, Samsung Galaxy A34

# First things first!
## BACK UP all your data
   * if you have Samsung account, just back it up through their cloud (recommended)
   * you can optionally back up through your Google account
   * if you have WHATSAPP, do NOT forget to backup through WA settings, then copy/move everything from Android/data/com.whatsapp, that includes downloaded medias

# Rooting
## 1. Unlock the "bootloader"
      to do so, you need 


      
  firmware is well, the software that is on your phone, which is Android OS (+ other samsung stuff = OneUI)
  you can use Frija to download

# I have downgraded to One UI 5.1 (thank goodnees the BINARY version is still the same), so i won't be continuing this list

## What benefits do I get from One UI 5.1?
* Opening from widgets transition
* Screenshoting work profile and secure folder directly
  (on One UI 6 it saves to its own user instead of user 0 aka. personal profile)
* better performance
  (i play Genshin it's a massively heavy game)
* better animations on gestures
  (i still can't comprehend the animations on One UI 6)

## What benefits do I get from One UI 6?
* better battery life
  (not very noticeable since it's like ~30 mins?)
* latest Android version
  (so i can enjoy multi-user on Firefds [UDC], the [Tiramisu] version is buggy and didn't get updated)

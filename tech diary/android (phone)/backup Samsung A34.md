this is my personal experience on backing up before resetting my own device, Samsung Galaxy A34

# backing up data
* if you have Samsung account, just back it up through their cloud (recommended)
* you can optionally back up through your Google account, that all is on Settings > Accounts and backup
* back up internal storage to sd card / another computer / another phone / etc.
* planning to reset a rooted device? back up your magisk and lsposed modules as well as the magiskhide list!

## why Samsung cloud?
it also backs up apps + games + lsposed modules that are installed outside play store, i found it very convenient

## my backup suggestions
* for WhatsApp, do NOT forget to back up through WA settings, then copy/move everything from Android/data/com.whatsapp, that includes downloaded medias
* for LINE, i guess just back up through google drive thingy etc., my phone number is banned from registration because i repeatedly reset phone lmoai i forgot
* i back up my internal storage with FX File Explorer, selecting all folders on there, and then make it .zip, i store without compressing just to be safe if in case my data got corrupted there, and then moving it to my laptop
* i love stacked widgets, so i also made a backup of it (+ i back up my "tiny" debloat list)

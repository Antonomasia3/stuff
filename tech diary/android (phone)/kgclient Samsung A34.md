you know that once removing kgclient you're locked by System UI with this message:

## Your phone is locked because Device services was uninstalled without authorization

# now how to uninstall it PROPERLY?

you know that you can replace the so-called "Device Owner" with 3rd party apps, such as Test DPC, Island / Insular, Dhizuku, etc. But unfortunately that does NOT work on unlocked bootloader
